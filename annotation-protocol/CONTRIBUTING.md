Annotation-Protocol: Guidelines for Contributing Tests
======================================================

This document describes the method people should use for authoring tests and
integrating them into the repository.  Anyone is welcome to submit new tests to
this collection.  If you do, please create the tests following the guidelines
below.  Then submit them as a pull request so they can be evaluated

Structure
---------

Tests are designed to exercise a Protocol Server.  The folder associated with these is:

* server - tests to be run against a server

Within this folder, special files ending with the suffix ".html" provide the source
for the test as a set javascript calls to perform the test.

* tools - supporting scripts and files
